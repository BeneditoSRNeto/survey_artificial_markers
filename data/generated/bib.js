        "abstract": "Fiducial markers provide better-defined features than the ones naturally available in the scene. For this reason, they are widely utilized in computer vision applications where reliable pose estimation is required. Factors such as imaging noise and subtle changes in illumination induce jitter on the estimated pose. Jitter impairs robustness in vision and robotics applications, and deteriorates the sense of presence and immersion in AR/VR applications. In this paper, we propose STag, a fiducial marker system that provides stable pose estimation. STag is designed to be robust against jitter factors, thus sustains pose stability better than the existing solutions. This is achieved by utilizing geometric features that can be localized more repeatably. The outer square border of the marker is used for detection and homography estimation. This is followed by a novel homography refinement step using the inner circular border. After refinement, the pose can be estimated stably and robustly across viewing conditions. These features are demonstrated with a comprehensive set of experiments, including comparisons with the state of the art fiducial marker systems.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decades fiducial markers have provided widely adopted tools to add reliable model-based features into an otherwise general scene. Given their central role in many computer vision tasks, countless different solutions have been proposed in the literature. Some designs are focused on the accuracy of the recovered camera pose with respect to the tag; some other concentrate on reaching high detection speed or on recognizing a large number of distinct markers in the scene. In such a crowded area both the researcher and the practitioner are licensed to wonder if there is any need to introduce yet another approach. Nevertheless, with this paper, we would like to present a general purpose fiducial marker system that can be deemed to add some valuable features to the pack. Specifically, by exploiting the projective properties of a circular set of sizeable dots, we propose a detection algorithm that is highly accurate. Further, applying a dot pattern scheme derived from errorcorrecting codes, allows for robustness with respect to very large occlusions. In addition, the design of the marker itself is flexible enough to accommodate different requirements in terms of pose accuracy and number of patterns. The overall performance of the marker system is evaluated in an extensive experimental section, where a comparison with a wellknown baseline technique is presented.",

Some tags are optimized to reach a high accuracy in the recovered camera pose, others are based on designs that aim to maximizing the detection speed or minimizing the effect of occlusion on the detection process. Most of them, however, employ a two-step procedure where an initial homography estimation is used to translate the marker from the image plane to an orthonormal world, where it is validated and recognized. In this paper, we present a general purpose fiducial marker system that performs both steps directly in image-space. Specifically, by exploiting projective invariants such as collinearity and cross-ratios, we introduce a detection and recognition algorithm that is fast, accurate and moderately robust to occlusion.

Our marker, Xtag, enjoys a novel design, coupled with very efficient and robust detection scheme, resulting in a reduced number of false positives. This is achieved by constructing markers with random circular features in the image domain and encoding them using two true perspective invariants: crossratios and intersection preservation constraints. To detect the markers, we developed an effective search scheme, similar to Geometric Hashing and Hough Voting, in which the marker decoding is cast as a retrieval problem. We apply our system to the task of camera calibration and bundle adjustment. With qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of X-tag in spite of blur, noise, perspective and radial distortions, and showcase camera calibration, bundle adjustment and 3d fusion of depth data from precise extrinsic camera poses.",

        "abstract": "Visual targets are used in space proximity operations to help in alignment of mechanical interfaces during, for example, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, and in robotic servicing of space structures. Distinctive and precisely placed target features facilitate unambiguous and reliable detection, and accurate estimation of relative position and orientation (pose) by the human operators or automatic vision systems. Existing targets used by vision systems typically do not allow for identification or for multiple targets to be visible in the field of view. The targets are detected in the first image and are tracked in successive frames, which introduce a potential failure condition. This paper describes a novel concept of a Space Vision Marker System (SVMS). Inspired by past designs of space targets and terrestrial marker systems, SVMS combines positive features of both and extends them to space applications. SVMS includes: the design of a family of markers, preferred imaging arrangement (camera, light, marker material), and software algorithms to detect the markers. The markers are reliably detected under a wide range of viewing distances and angles, and illumination (including direct sun light and shadows); encoded redundant features allow identification even with a partial data loss. Three dimensional structures of the markers allow accurate pose estimation. The detection algorithms operate on each image separately and in real time, which does not require tracking between frames and allows instant recovery from failures due to, e.g., marker occlusions. Results of laboratory tests performed under conditions representative to proximity operations in lower earth orbit are also presented.",

Relying on projective properties, it allows to robustly localize the imaged marker and to accurately detect the position of the image of the (common) circle center.

The UAV has to be able to detect the landing target and to perform the landing maneuver without compromising its own safety and the integrity of its surroundings. However, current UAVs do not present the required robustness and reliability for precise landing in highly demanding scenarios, particularly due to their inadequacy to perform accordingly under challenging lighting and weather conditions, including in day and night operations. This work proposes a multimodal fiducial marker, named ArTuga (Augmented Reality Tag for Unmanned vision-Guided Aircraft), capable of being detected by an heterogeneous perception system for accurate and precise landing in challenging environments and daylight conditions. This research combines photometric and radiometric information by proposing a real-time multimodal fusion technique that ensures a robust and reliable detection of the landing target in severe environments. Experimental results using a real multicopter UAV show that the system was able to detect the proposed marker in adverse conditions (such as at different heights, with intense sunlight and in dark environments). The obtained average accuracy for position estimation at 1\u00a0m height was of 0.0060 m with a standard deviation of 0.0003\u00a0m. Precise landing tests obtained an average deviation of 0.027\u00a0m from the proposed marker, with a standard deviation of 0.026\u00a0m. These results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed system for the precise landing in adverse conditions, such as in day and night operations with harsh weather conditions.",

We compare a purely mathematical representation of the paper manifold with a soft-body-physics model and demonstrate the use of our visual tracking method to facilitate the coordination of two anthropomorphic 20 DOF Shadow Dexterous Hands while they grasp a flat-lying piece of paper, using a combination of visually guided bulging and pinching.",

        "abstract": "A new and aesthetic marker technique for indoor robot localization is presented in this paper. The marker, as a visual landmark, is designed to fit human inhabited indoor environments, where aesthetic considerations are as much important as efficiency of the visual localization. Design development was performed using color filtration and shape detection of the marker image. HSV color space was used for color separation, then hue component values of the highest geometric distance were selected for contrast decisions. This method allows the extraction of contrasting color information, where contrast values were lowered until machine visual detection was efficient enough whilst marker image aesthetics were still enjoyable for the human viewer. Separated colors were examined by shape detection for geometry, size and orientation to introduce the marker elements. Results of the aesthetic marker feature tracking illustrate marker information retrieval. In conclusion, aesthetic markers, when harmonized with color preference, can be integrated unobtrusively into home environments and are efficient for robot localization.",

They are useful for Augmented Reality (AR), robot navigation, and general applications where the relative pose between a camera and object is required. Important parameters for such marker systems is their false detection rate (false positive rate), their inter-marker confusion rate, minimal detection size (in pixels) and immunity to lighting variation. ARTag is a marker system that uses digital coding theory to get a very low false positive and inter-marker confusion rate with a small required marker size, employing an edge linking method to give robust lighting variation immunity. ARTag markers are bi-tonal planar patterns containing a unique ID number encoded with robust digital techniques of checksums and forward error correction (FEC). This proposed new system, ARTag has very low and numerically quantifiable error rates, does not require a greyscale threshold as does other marker systems, and can encode up to 2002 different unique ID\u2019s with no need to store patterns.

Many augmented reality applications solve this problem with the help of markerbased methods, which analyze artificial fiducials in the images of the real environment, e.g., using the widespread ARToolKit library. Among the drawbacks of conventional marker tracking is the necessity to manually define marker patterns. Badly chosen patterns have a negative impact on tracking performance. Although improved methods for automatic marker generation have been described, manually controlled marker tracking is still widely used in many applications for practical reasons. In this paper, we describe a lightweight drop-in extension for IDbased marker tracking. Our system makes it possible to automatically generate a large number of tracking fiducials identified by unique numerical IDs. The created marker patterns consists of large monochrome patches, which improves the recognition rate and tracking performance compared to typical manually defined fiducials. Due to the design of our extension, only minimal adaptations are required in order to add ID-based tracking to existing augmented reality software. We discuss experimental results demonstrating the improved pattern recognition and describe an example application.",

Fiducial markers, specifically ArUco and Apriltag, are preferred for their efficiency. However, their accuracy and viewing angle are limited when used as single markers. Custom fiducial objects have been developed to address these limitations by attaching markers to 3D objects, enhancing visibility from multiple viewpoints and improving precision. Existing methods mainly use square markers on non-square object faces, leading to inefficient space use. This paper introduces a novel approach for creating fiducial objects with custom-shaped markers that optimize face coverage, enhancing space utilization and marker detectability at greater distances. Furthermore, we present a technique for the precise configuration estimation of these objects using multiviewpoint images. We provide the research community with our code, tutorials, and an application to facilitate the building and calibration of these objects. Our empirical analysis assesses the effectiveness of various fiducial objects for pose estimation across different conditions, such as noise levels, blur, and scale variations. The results suggest that our customized markers significantly outperform traditional square markers, marking a positive advancement in fiducial marker-based pose estimation methods.",

In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation.

The two networks are trained simultaneously in a joint backpropagation process that takes characteristic photometric and geometric distortions associated with marker fabrication and marker scanning into account. Additionally, a stylization loss based on statistics of activations in a pretrained classification network can be inserted into the learning in order to shift the marker appearance towards some texture prototype. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the markers obtained using our approach are capable of retaining bit strings that are long enough to be practical. The ability to automatically adapt markers according to the usage scenario and the desired capacity as well as the ability to combine information encoding with artistic stylization are the unique properties of our approach. As a byproduct, our approach provides an insight on the structure of patterns that are most suitable for recognition by ConvNets and on their ability to distinguish composite patterns.",

In these cases, it would be preferable to use customized markers showing, for instance, a company logo. This work proposes a novel method to design, detect, and track customizable fiducial markers. Our work allows creating markers templates imposing few restrictions on its design, e.g., a company logo or a picture can be used. The designer must indicate positions into the template where bits will encode a unique identifier for each marker. Then, our method will automatically create a dictionary of markers, all following the same design, but each with a unique identifier. Finally, we propose a method for detecting and tracking the markers even under occlusion, which is not allowed in traditional fiducial markers.

This paper presents a novel method which utilizes directly the projective invariant contained in the positional relation of the corresponding feature point's to encode the marker. The proposed method does not require the region of pattern image for encoding any more and can provide more corresponding feature points so that higher pose accuracy can be achieved easily. Many related approaches such as cumulative distribution function, reprojection verification and robust process are proposed to overcome the problem of sensibility of the projective invariant.

        "abstract": "In augmented reality systems, the three dimensional registration technology based on artificial markers has been widely used. The registration algorithm based on artificial markers is divided into two steps: (1) marker detection and recognition, (2) estimation of camera pose. In this paper, a novel marker is designed based on projective invariants principle, such as collinearity between points and cross-ratio. Compared with the markers used in the ARToolkit, our new marker can greatly reduce the storage space of marker templates. And based on this marker, a new detection and recognition algorithm is proposed. By using the algorithm, the registration in AR system still can be successfully completed even when the marker is occluded by 62.5%, which greatly improves the robustness of the registration algorithm. The experimental results show that the marker and the algorithm posed in this paper are effective.",

While square fiducial markers have found widespread use in industrial and entertainment sectors for precise object identification and tracking, their integration into daily wearable items has been limited due to their conspicuous appearance. Previous efforts to conceal these markers using infrared-based methods have encountered obstacles, often requiring specialized equipment and lighting conditions. In this study, we propose a fresh perspective by embedding the markers within the timeless Pied-de-poule pattern, enhancing their visibility for tracking purposes and their fashion appeal. We use computational tools to design and manufacture functional garments using sublimation printing and traditional handcrafting techniques. Through rigorous technical evaluation and exploratory making, we analyze the characteristics of these markers and explore their material potential, offering valuable insights and guidelines for their seamless integration into future wearable applications.",

While the proposed algorithm achieves similar accuracy to other state-of-the-art methods, its experimental evaluation in realistic conditions demonstrates that it can detect markers from larger distances while being up to two orders of magnitude faster than other stateof-the art fiducial marker detection methods.

Firstly, the contours of the color marker patterns on the video images are extracted by using adaptive threshold. Each marker pattern on the image is corrected and recognized by the template pattern. Secondly, the specified color markers are identified by using the L1L2L3 and rgb models. Finally, the virtual objects are registered in real-time on the marker image by using the camera parameters derived from data of the color markers. The experimental results show that the virtual objects can be accurately registered on the markers of the video images.

        "abstract": "A robust and effective method for the identification of point-distributed coded targets (IPCT) in a video-simultaneous triangulation and resection system (V-STARS) was reported recently. However, its limitations were the setting of critical parameters, it being non-adaptive, making misidentifications in certain conditions, having low positioning precision, and its identification effect being slightly inferior to that of the V-STARS. Aiming to address these shortcomings of IPCT, an improved IPCT, named I-IPCT, with an adaptive binarization, a more precise ellipse-center localization, and especially an invariance of the point\u2013line distance ratio (PLDR), was proposed. In the process of edge extraction, the adaptive threshold Gaussian function was adopted to realize the acquisition of an adaptive binarization threshold. For the process of center positioning of round targets, the gray cubic weighted centroid algorithm was adopted to realize high-precision center localization. In the template point recognition procedure, the invariant of the PLDR was used to realize the determination of template points adaptively. In the decoding procedure, the invariant of the PLDR was adopted to eliminate confusion. Experiments in indoor, outdoor, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) settings were carried out; meanwhile, sufficient comparisons with IPCT and V-STARS were performed. The results show that the improvements can make the identification approximately parameter-free and more accurate. Meanwhile, it presented a high three-dimensional measurement precision in close-range photogrammetry. The improved IPCT performed equally well as the commercial software V-STARS on the whole and was slightly superior to it in the UAV test, in which it provided a fantastic open solution using these kinds of coded targets and making it convenient for researchers to freely apply the coded targets in many aspects, including UAV photogrammetry for high-precision automatic image matching and three-dimensional real-scene reconstruction.",

This is constrained to the fiducial maker systems, since they only work within the RGB image space. As a result, noises in the image produce large pose estimation errors. In robotic applications, fiducial markers have been mainly used in its original and simple form, as a plane in a printed paper sheet. This setup is sufficient for basic visual servoing and augmented reality applications, but not for complex swarm robotic applications in which the setup consists of multiple dynamic markers (tags displayed on LCD screen). This paper describes a novel methodology, called AprilTags3D, that improves pose estimation accuracy of AprilTags in field robotics with only RGB sensor by adding a third dimension to the marker detector.

Physical spaces are made sentient when they are wired with networks of sensors capturing context data, which is communicated to computing devices spread through the environment. These devices interpret the information provided and react by performing the actions expected by the user. Among the types of context information provided by sensors, location has proven to be especially useful. Since location is an important context that changes whenever the user moves, a reliable location-tracking system is critical to many sentient applications. However, the sensor technologies used in indoor location tracking are expensive and complex to deploy, configure and maintain. These factors have prevented a wider adoption of Sentient Computing in our living and working spaces. This paper presents TRIP, a low-cost and easily deployable vision-based sensor technology addressing these issues. TRIP employs off-the-shelf hardware (lowcost CCD cameras and PCs) and printable 2-D circular markers for entity identification and location. The usability of TRIP is illustrated through the implementation of several sentient applications.",

The marker employs a set of tape-shaped markers that facilitate their positioning in the environment, allowing continuous reading to cover the entire perimeter of the environment and making it possible to minimize interruptions in the location service. Because the marker is present throughout the perimeter of the environment, it presents hierarchical coding patterns that allow it to be robust against multiple detection scales. We implemented an application to help the user generate the markers with a floor plan image. We conducted two types of tests, one in a 3D simulation environment and one in a real-life environment with a smartphone. The tests made it possible to measure the performance of the tape-shaped marker with readings at multiple distances compared to ArUco, QRCode, and STag with detections at distances of 10 to 0.5 m. The localization tests in the 3D environment analyzed the time of marker detection during the journey from one room to another in positioning conditions (A) with the markers positioned at the baseboard of the wall, (B) with the markers positioned at camera height, and (C) with the marker positioned on the floor. The localization tests in real conditions allowed us to measure the time of detections in favorable conditions of detections, demonstrating that the tape-shaped-marker-detection algorithm is not yet robust against blurring but is robust against lighting variations, difficult angle displays, and partial occlusions. In both test environments, the marker allowed for detection at multiple scales, confirming its functionality.",

        "abstract": "Fiducials are commonly placed in environments to provide a uniquely identifiable object in the scene. In quadcopter applications, these fiducials are often used to evaluate planning algorithms given that ground truth positions can be detected from the quadcopter\u2019s camera. Low cost quadcopters, however, are subject to quick and unstable motions that can cause significant motion blur that severely affects the detection rate of existing fiducials. This problem motivated us to design a fiducial that is robust to motion blur. Our proposed design uses concentric circles with the observation that the direction perpendicular to the motion blur direction will be relatively unaffected by the blur. As a result, an appropriate fiducial code orthogonal to the blur direction can be recognized. Since the direction of motion blur is unknown, the circular design is good for all motion blur directions. We describe the design of binary fiducials, and also a detection algorithm. We show that our marker can significantly outperform existing fiducials in scenes captured with a quadcopter.",

To avoid the registration problem between the virtual world and the real world, the user\u2019s pose in both worlds should be exactly the same. Fiducial tracking AR is an attractive approach to the registration problem, but most of the developed fiducial tracking AR systems have very limited tracking ranges and require carefully prepared environments, especially lighting conditions. To provide for wide views and detailed views in large-scale applications, an AR system should have a scalable tracking capability under varying light condition. In this paper, we propose multi-ring color fiducial systems and a lightinvariant fiducial detection method for scalable fiducial tracking AR systems. We analyze the optimal ring width, and develop formulas to obtain the optimal fiducial set with system specific inputs. We present a light-invariant circular fiducial detection method that uses relations among fiducials and their backgrounds for segmenting regions of an image. Our work provides a simple and convenient way to achieve wide-area tracking for AR.",

One way to measure these PSFs is their calibration with checkerboard patterns. Previous work, however, does not fully exploit all benefits of using a checkerboard. In particular, we show in this paper that the pose of the checkerboard with respect to the camera can be exploited to yield information on the circle of confusion, and thus the image blur of an ideal camera. By removing this expected blur, we can estimate residual PSFs that are due to the deviation of the optical system from a thin-lens model. The residual PSFs can then be used to sharpen images at comparable lens settings. Practical side effects of our method are the design of a self-identifying pattern that can be robustly detected even in the case of image blur, and a corresponding algorithm for its detection.",

        "abstract": "Squared planar markers have become a popular method for pose estimation in applications such as autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles or virtual trainers. The markers allow estimating the position of a monocular camera with minimal cost, high robustness, and speed. One only needs to create markers with a regular printer, place them in the desired environment so as to cover the working area, and then registering their location from a set of images. Nevertheless, marker detection is a time-consuming process, especially as the image dimensions grows. Modern cameras are able to acquire high resolutions images, but fiducial marker systems are not adapted in terms of computing speed. This paper proposes a multi-scale strategy for speeding up marker detection in video sequences by wisely selecting the most appropriate scale for detection, identification and corner estimation. The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. Our method is up to 40 times faster than the state-of-the-art method, achieving over 1000 fps in 4K images without any parallelization.",

        "abstract": "Squared fiducial markers are a powerful tool for camera pose estimation in applications such as robots, unmanned vehicles and augmented reality. The four corners of a single marker are enough to estimate the pose of a calibrated camera. However, they have some limitations. First, the methods proposed for detection are ineffective under occlusion. A small occlusion in any part of the marker makes it undetectable. Second, the range at which they can be detected is limited by their size. Very big markers can be detected from a far distance, but as the camera approaches them, they are not fully visible, and thus they can not be detected. Small markers, however, can not be detected from large distances. This paper proposes solutions to the above-mentioned problems. We propose the Fractal Marker, a novel type of marker that is built as an aggregation of squared markers, one into another, in a recursive manner. Also, we proposed a novel method for detecting Fractal Markers under severe occlusions. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method achieves a wider detection range than traditional markers and great robustness to occlusion.",

Our innovative approach to marker-based 3D position tracking uses seamless patterns encrypted with positional data. Although users can obtain 3D positional data by processing marker images similar to many existing marker-based systems, our markers are designed with interior decoration in mind. That way they can be installed in walls, floors, or ceilings. Unlike existing systems whose fiducial markers were designed first and foremost to be processed by computers, ours are visually attractive. By integrating positional information within the interior design, our system enables users to enjoy the benefits of position tracking without being constantly aware of the system\u2019s presence. We developed a method for making patterns in which positional information is encrypted and a method for calculating the 3D position of a user by decoding those patterns.

In this paper we introduce a novel iterative geometric method for pose estimation from four co-planar points and we present the current status of PTrack, a marker-based single camera tracking system benefiting from this approach. The system uses an IDS uEye [1] camera, equipped with infrared flash strobes and infrared pass filter, which acquires grayscale images and sends them to a computer where an image pre-processing algorithm identifies potential projections of retro-reflective markers. Our novel pose estimation algorithm identifies possible labels composed of markers in a 2D post-processing using a divide-and-conquer strategy to segment the camera's image space and attempts an iterative geometric 3D reconstruction of position and orientation in camera space. In the end successfully reconstructed labels are compared to a database for identification. Their 6 DoF data as well as their ID is made available to applications through OpenTracker [2] framework. To assess the performance of our approach we compared PTrack to ARToolKit [3] - which has been adapted to work with the same camera - and final results show that pose estimation is more accurate and precise, in both translation and rotation.",

        "abstract": "Visual fiducial systems are a key component of many robotics and AR/VR applications for 6-DOF monocular relative pose estimation and target identification. This paper presents LFTag, a visual fiducial system based on topological detection and relative position data encoding which optimizes data density within spatial frequency constraints. The marker is constructed to resolve rotational ambiguity, which combined with the robust geometric and topological false positive rejection, allows all marker bits to be used for data. When compared to existing state-of-the-art square binary markers (AprilTag) and topological markers (TopoTag) in simulation, the proposed fiducial system (LFTag) offers significant advances in dictionary size and range. LFTag 3x3 achieves 546 times the dictionary size of AprilTag 25h9 and LFTag 4x4 achieves 126 thousand times the dictionary size of AprilTag 41h12 while simultaneously achieving longer detection range. LFTag 3x3 also achieves more than twice the detection range of TopoTag 4x4 at the same dictionary size.",

        "abstract": "High-precision pose estimation based on visual markers has been a thriving research topic in the field of computer vision. However, the suitability of traditional flat markers on curved objects is limited due to the diverse shapes of curved surfaces, which hinders the development of high-precision pose estimation for curved objects. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel visual marker called CylinderTag, which is designed for developable curved surfaces such as cylindrical surfaces. CylinderTag is a cyclic marker that can be firmly attached to objects with a cylindrical shape. Leveraging the manifold assumption, the cross-ratio in projective invariance is utilized for encoding in the direction of zero curvature on the surface. Additionally, to facilitate the usage of CylinderTag, we propose a heuristic search-based marker generator and a high-performance recognizer as well. Moreover, an all-encompassing evaluation of CylinderTag properties is conducted by means of extensive experimentation, covering detection rate, detection speed, dictionary size, localization jitter, and pose estimation accuracy. CylinderTag showcases superior detection performance from varying view angles in comparison to traditional visual markers, accompanied by higher localization accuracy. Furthermore, CylinderTag boasts real-time detection capability and an extensive marker dictionary, offering enhanced versatility and practicality in a wide range of applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the CylinderTag is a highly promising visual marker for use on cylindrical-like surfaces, thus offering important guidance for future research on high-precision visual localization of cylinder-shaped objects.

        "abstract": "The use of continuum manipulators in surgical applications can be beneficial because of their inherent safety from their structural compliance. However, the tip pose (position and orientation) accuracy of a continuum manipulator can be low when an external load or disturbance is applied. Closed-loop pose control is preferred to improve the pose accuracy. Considering the requirements stemmed from sterilization and medical device electromagnetic compatibility, the approach of fully utilizing the vision feedback from a stereo endoscopic camera for such a closedloop pose controller is adopted. Wrist markers are attached to the end-effectors of the surgical continuum manipulators for pose information detection. And these wrist markers are designed in a well-considered way to generate enough variants. The closed-loop pose controller is then designed based on a stereo vision tracking algorithm that detects the position and orientation of the wrist marker. A switching feature is also incorporated into the controller to handle the situation when the closed-loop control is disrupted due to the visual occlusion or the operation transition in dual-arm manipulation. Experimental verification showed that the average errors of the pose feedback are 0.65 mm for the position and 1.05\u00b0 for the orientation. The experiments of trajectory following under a 120-gram external load and automated dual-arm suturing were also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "Fiducial markers have been broadly used to identify objects or embed messages that can be detected by a camera. Primarily, existing detection methods assume that markers are printed on ideally planar surfaces. The size of a message or identification code is limited by the spatial resolution of binary patterns in a marker. Markers often fail to be recognized due to various imaging artifacts of optical/perspective distortion and motion blur. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deformable fiducial marker system that consists of three main parts: First, a fiducial marker generator creates a set of free-form color patterns to encode significantly large-scale information in unique visual codes. Second, a differentiable image simulator creates a training dataset of photorealistic scene images with the deformed markers, being rendered during optimization in a differentiable manner. The rendered images include realistic shading with specular reflection, optical distortion, defocus and motion blur, color alteration, imaging noise, and shape deformation of markers. Lastly, a trained marker detector seeks the regions of interest and recognizes multiple marker patterns simultaneously via inverse deformation transformation. The deformable marker creator and detector networks are jointly optimized via the differentiable photorealistic renderer in an end-to-end manner, allowing us to robustly recognize a wide range of deformable markers with high accuracy. Our deformable marker system is capable of decoding 36-bit messages successfully at \u223c29 fps with severe shape deformation. Results validate that our system significantly outperforms the traditional and data-driven marker methods. Our learning-based marker system opens up new interesting applications of fiducial markers, including cost-effective motion capture of the human body, active 3D scanning using our fiducial markers\u2019 array as structured light patterns, and robust augmented reality rendering of virtual objects on dynamic surfaces",

        "abstract": "Augmented maps have many important applications. However, no mature registration method exists to associate unprepared maps with a Geographical Information System (GIS) database which would be used to superimpose simulation results or route display on a paper map. In this paper, we propose a method called Robust Ran- dom Dot Markers (RRDM) that can robustly track coplanar random dot patterns, which can be used to address this problem. RRDM is based on the same idea of the Random Dot Markers (RDM) pro- posed by [Uchiyama and Saito 2011] and it can serve as fiducial markers as well as texture independent \"natural markers\". We con- duct a series of experiments and show that RRDM is more robust than RDM in terms of jitter, perspective distortion, under and over detection of dots in the pattern. As an example of \"natural marker\", we show that RRDM can successfully register unprepared printed maps only with pure geographic features, i.e. road intersections coordinates, which we retrieve from a GIS. Our method does not suffer from the drawbacks of traditional \"feature-point\" based reg- istration methods which mainly based on textures, since textures may change according to\u00a0different\u00a0maps.",

        "abstract": "Fiducial markers have been playing an important role in augmented reality (AR), robot navigation, and general applications where the relative pose between a camera and an object is required. Here we introduce TopoTag, a robust and scalable topological fiducial marker system, which supports reliable and accurate pose estimation from a single image. TopoTag uses topological and geometrical information in marker detection to achieve higher robustness. Topological information is extensively used for 2D marker detection, and further corresponding geometrical information for ID decoding. Robust 3D pose estimation is achieved by taking advantage of all TopoTag vertices. Without sacrificing bits for higher recall and precision like previous systems, TopoTag can use full bits for ID encoding. TopoTag supports tens of thousands unique IDs and easily extends to millions of unique tags resulting in massive scalability. We collected a large test dataset including in total 169,713 images for evaluation, involving in-plane and out-of-plane rotation, image blur, different distances, and various backgrounds, etc. Experiments on the dataset and real indoor and outdoor scene tests with a rolling shutter camera both show that TopoTag significantly outperforms previous fiducial marker systems in terms of various metrics, including detection accuracy, vertex jitter, pose jitter and accuracy, etc. In addition, TopoTag supports occlusion as long as the main tag topological structure is maintained and allows for flexible shape design where users can customize internal and external marker shapes.

        "abstract": "Purpose - To provide an integrated visualisation of intraoperative ultrasound and endoscopic images to facilitate intraoperative guidance, real-time tracking of the ultrasound probe is required. State-of-the-art methods are suitable for planar targets while most of the laparoscopic ultrasound probes are cylindrical objects. A tracking framework for cylindrical objects with a large work space will improve the usability of the intraoperative ultrasound guidance. Methods - A hybrid marker design that combines circular dots and chessboard vertices is proposed for facilitating tracking cylindrical tools. The circular dots placed over the curved surface are used for pose estimation. The chessboard vertices are employed to provide additional information for resolving the ambiguous pose problem due to the use of planar model points under a monocular camera. Furthermore, temporal information between consecutive images is considered to minimise tracking failures with real-time computational performance. Results - Detailed validation confirms that our hybrid marker provides a large working space for different tool sizes (6\u201314mm in diameter). The tracking framework allows translational movements between 40 and 185mm along the depth direction and rotational motion around three local orthogonal axes up to \u00b180\u25e6. Comparative studies with the current state of the art confirm that our approach outperforms existing methods by providing nearly 100% detection rates and accurate pose estimation with mean errors of 2.8mm and 0.72\u25e6. The tracking algorithm runs at 20 frames per second for 960 \u00d7 540 image resolution videos. Conclusion - Experiments show that the proposed hybrid marker can be applied to a wide range of surgical tools with superior detection rates and pose estimation accuracies. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our framework can be used not only for assisting intraoperative ultrasound guidance but also for tracking general surgical tools in MIS.",

        "abstract": "A fiducial marker system usually consists of markers, a detection algorithm, and a coding system. The appearance of markers and the detection robustness are generally limited by the existing detection algorithms, which are hand-crafted with traditional low-level image processing techniques. Furthermore, a sophisticatedly designed coding system is required to overcome the shortcomings of both markers and detection algorithms. To improve the flexibility and robustness in various applications, we propose a general deep learning based framework, DeepTag, for fiducial marker design and detection. DeepTag not only supports detection of a wide variety of existing marker families, but also makes it possible to design new marker families with customized local patterns. Moreover, we propose an effective procedure to synthesize training data on the fly without manual annotations. Thus, DeepTag can easily adapt to existing and newly-designed marker families. To validate DeepTag and existing methods, beside existing datasets, we further collect a new large and challenging dataset where markers are placed in different view distances and angles. Experiments show that DeepTag well supports different marker families and greatly outperforms the existing methods in terms of both detection robustness and pose accuracy.
